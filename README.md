## About
The [Battleship](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship) project was created for The Odin Project's 'Testing Javascript' section. The main objectives were to practice TDD(Test Driven Development) and as a result, isolating each part of the application's functionality. This was also another opportunity to practice writing and running the unit tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
The player can choose the name they would like to play as before being able to drag and place their ships on to their board. Once all of their ships have been placed, the Ai's board will appear and the player and ai can take turns attacking a square on the opposing board. Once all the ships on a board are sunk, the game will end and the winner will be displayed.
<br/><br/>
These are some of the challenges I face while making this project:
- Becoming comfortable writing tests before refactoring my code (and repeating)
- Allowing the ships to be dragged and placed on to the board
- Getting the placed ships to occupy the appopriate number of squares
- Checking whether an attacked square was occupied by a ship or not
- Updating the board to show an attack missed or hit a ship
<br/>
If I started this project again, I would implement a way for the user to be able to place their ships horizontally or vertically as opposed to only vertically.
