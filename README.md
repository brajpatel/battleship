## About
The [Battleship](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship) project was created for The Odin Project's 'Testing Javascript' section. The main objectives were to practice TDD(Test Driven Development) and as a result, isolating each part of the application's functionality.
<br/><br/>
These are some of the challenges I face while making this project:
- Becoming comfortable writing tests before refactoring my code (and repeating)
- Allowing the ships to be dragged and placed on to the board
